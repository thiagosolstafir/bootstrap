    "Best practices": "",
    "We recommend the following guidelines for using button groups and toolbars:": "",

    "Flexible alignment": "",

    "Pager": "",

    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",
    "Goes great with javascript": "",

    "Highly customizable": "",
    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",

    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",

    "Flexible alignment": "",

    "Pager": "",

    "Highly customizable": "",
    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",
    "Goes great with javascript": "",

    "Wrap your message and an optional close icon in a div with simple class.": "",
    "Warning!": "",

    "Page header and hero unit for segmenting content": "",
    "Hero unit": "",
    "Bootstrap provides a lightweight, flexible component called a hero unit to showcase content on your site. It works well on marketing and content-heavy sites.": "",
    "Wrap your content in a <code>div</code> like so:": "",
    "Heading": "",

    "Default thumbnails": "",
    "By default, Bootstrap's thumbnails are designed to showcase linked images with minimal required markup.": "",
    "Highly customizable": "",
    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",
    "Goes great with javascript": "",
    "Bootstrap comes with a great jQuery plugin that supports alert messages, making dismissing them quick and easy.": "",
    "Get the plugin &raquo;</a>": "",
    "Example alerts": "",
    "Wrap your message and an optional close icon in a div with simple class.": "",
    "Warning!": "",
    "Best check yo self, you're not looking too good.": "",
    "Easily extend the standard alert message with two optional classes: <code>.alert-block</code> for more padding and text controls and <code>.alert-heading</code> for a matching heading.": "",

    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",

    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",

    "Flexible alignment": "",

    "Highly customizable": "",
    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",
    "Goes great with javascript": "",
